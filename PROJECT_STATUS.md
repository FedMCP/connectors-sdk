## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### Artifact Structure
- **Types**: SSP fragments, POA&M templates, agent recipes, baseline modules, audit scripts
- **Size Limit**: 1MB per artifact
- **Signing**: JWS with ES256 (ECDSA P-256)
- **Storage**: S3 for artifacts, PostgreSQL for metadata

### Security Requirements
- Per-workspace KMS keys
- 180-day key rotation
- Immutable audit trail
- CloudWatch integration

### API Endpoints
- `POST /artifacts` - Create and sign
- `GET /artifacts/{id}` - Retrieve
- `POST /artifacts/{id}/verify` - Verify signature
- `GET /jwks/{workspace_id}` - Get public keys
- `GET /audit/events` - Query audit trail
