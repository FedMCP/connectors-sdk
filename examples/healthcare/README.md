# Healthcare AI Artifact Examples

This directory contains example FedMCP artifacts demonstrating how government healthcare organizations can use the protocol for AI/ML governance and compliance.

## Example Artifacts

### 1. Clinical Decision Support Agent (`clinical_decision_support.json`)

A comprehensive artifact describing a VA clinical decision support AI system. This example shows:

- **Model governance**: Version control, training data provenance, validation metrics
- **Compliance tracking**: HIPAA, FedRAMP, FDA considerations
- **Deployment details**: Infrastructure, endpoints, SLAs
- **Clinical validation**: Review board approval, limitations, safety controls
- **Audit requirements**: Event tracking, retention policies

**Use Case**: Track and verify AI models used for clinical recommendations in VA hospitals

### 2. Population Health Analysis (`population_health_analysis.json`)

An LLM completion artifact for population health analytics. Demonstrates:

- **Query tracking**: What questions were asked of the AI
- **Data sources**: Which datasets were analyzed
- **Results documentation**: Risk cohorts, geographic analysis, SDOH factors
- **Outcome projections**: Expected impact of interventions
- **Privacy compliance**: De-identification, aggregation thresholds

**Use Case**: Document AI-driven population health insights for program planning

### 3. HIPAA Compliance Audit Script (`audit_trail_example.json`)

An automated audit script for verifying HIPAA compliance of AI systems. Shows:

- **Automated checks**: Access control, encryption, audit logs
- **Compliance mapping**: HIPAA, HITECH, VA directives
- **Remediation workflows**: Escalation paths for findings
- **Continuous monitoring**: Scheduled execution and reporting

**Use Case**: Automate compliance verification for AI systems handling PHI

## Key Benefits for Healthcare

These examples demonstrate how FedMCP enables:

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Track AI compliance with HIPAA, FDA, FedRAMP
2. **Clinical Safety**: Document validation, limitations, and safety controls
3. **Audit Readiness**: Maintain immutable records for regulatory audits
4. **Quality Assurance**: Version control and provenance for clinical AI
5. **Risk Management**: Document and track AI-related risks
6. **Transparency**: Clear documentation of AI capabilities and limitations

## Creating Healthcare Artifacts

When creating healthcare AI artifacts:

1. **Always include compliance frameworks** (HIPAA, FDA, etc.)
2. **Document data sources and privacy controls**
3. **Include clinical validation information**
4. **Specify limitations and contraindications**
5. **Define audit and retention requirements**
6. **Track model versions and changes**

## Integration with Healthcare Systems

These artifacts can integrate with:
- Electronic Health Records (EHR)
- Clinical Decision Support Systems
- Population Health Platforms
- Compliance Management Systems
- Quality Assurance Programs

## Security Considerations

- All artifacts are signed with ECDSA P-256
- PHI is never included in artifacts
- Access controlled by workspace isolation
- Audit trail for all operations
- Encryption in transit and at rest

## Next Steps

1. Customize these examples for your organization
2. Integrate with your AI governance process
3. Automate artifact creation in your ML pipeline
4. Set up continuous compliance monitoring
5. Share artifacts across departments securely
